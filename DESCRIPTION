Description: A collection of functions that calculate a disease-specific hazard
  ratio from an overall hazard ratio that evaluates the effectiveness of an 
  intervention from a clinical trial. This repository is part of the following 
  working paper submitted for publication: Alarid-Escudero F, Kuntz KM. 
  "Potential bias associated with modeling the effectiveness of healthcare 
  interventions in reducing mortality using an overall hazard ratio". (2019).
